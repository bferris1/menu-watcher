# Purdue Menu Checker
Final lab for CS 252: Systems Programming

This application allows students to choose which dining court to go to based on their favorite meals.

After signing up, users can then import favorites from their Purdue account if they already have some, or they can search all menu items and add them to their favorites.

After adding or importing favorites, users can then select a date and meal time and view which of the dining courts have their favorite foods.
